QUICK START

1. Extract the source, excute "./checkout" .

2. Install the binary toolchain as described in the WiKi.

Or build the toolchain,

cd toolchain-build
make gcc elf2flt gdb-host
cd ..

Then add the PATH to your profile file, .bash_profile or .profile , like 
this, PATH=$PATH:/home/hippo/nios2-linux/toolchain-build/build/nios2/bin

3. Build the Linux image,

cd uClinux-dist
make menuconfig
make vendor_hwselect SYSPTF=/your/path/to/the/system/ptf
make

4. Only if you are behind a proxy firewall and cannot use git protocol, 
you can change the git to use http to get updates from community server 
with this command, "./use_http_for_update" . But this is very slow and
not recommended.

5. You can fetch updates from server with, "./update" .


Enjoy!!
