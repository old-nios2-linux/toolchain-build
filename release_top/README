QUICK START

1. Extract the source, excute "./checkout" .

2. Install the binary toolchain as described in the WiKi.

Or build the toolchain,

cd toolchain-build
make gcc elf2flt gdb-host
cd ..

Then add the PATH to your profile file, .bash_profile or .profile , like 
this, PATH=$PATH:/home/hippo/nios2-linux/toolchain-build/build/nios2/bin

3. Build the Linux image,

cd uClinux-dist
make menuconfig
make vendor_hwselect SYSPTF=/your/path/to/the/system/ptf
make

4. Get source updates from community server.

Normally you will use "git" protocol to get update from server if your PC
is directly connected to the Internet. Then you may skip to step 5.

Only if you are behind a proxy firewall and cannot use git protocol, 
you can change the git to use ssh tunneling through port 443 to get updates
from community server with this command, "./use_ssh443_for_update" .

You should have ssh tunneling package installed, such as "corkscrew".
Add the following 3 lines to your ~/.ssh/config, which should have no
public access, "chmod og-rwx config". Replace <http_proxy_ip> <port>
to that of your http proxy server.

IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
IdentityFile ~/nios2-linux/sshkey/id_rsa
ProxyCommand corkscrew <http_proxy_ip> <port> %h %p
    
If you failed to use ssh tunnling as above, you may try dumb http protocol
with this command, "./use_http_for_update" . But this is very slow and not 
recommended.

You may revert to git protocol when there is no firewall blocking with this
command, "./use_git_for_update" . 

5. Now You can fetch updates from server with, "./update" .


Enjoy!!
